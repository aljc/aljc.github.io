            Hi, I'm <a href="http://linkedin.com/in/alicejc" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Alice</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
            I work at the intersection of engineering, product, and generative tools. Currently, I am an
            engineering leader at Meta.
          </p>
          <p>
            I enjoy the chaos of early-stage product development - taking ambitious, undefined ideas and
            turning them into scalable reality. Previously, I led the AI product engineering team within Pinterest's
            Advanced Technologies Group, bridging product, engineering, and applied research.
          </p>
          <p>
            In a previous life, I founded compileHer, a nonprofit organization that introduces middle-school girls in Southside Chicago to
            computer science.
          </p>

            This site is where I keep informal notes on how we build, what we value, and how our tools
            quietly reshape the way we think. These essays are not polished manifestos so much as
            field notes...fragments from a changing mind, written in public as I go.
