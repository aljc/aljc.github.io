                        <p>Created <a href="https://github.com/aljc/MomentsApp" target="_blank">Moments</a>, a social and visual gratitude journal app.  Our lives have become dominated by technology, and we can forget to pause and enjoy the moment. Technology should serve as a bridge, not obstacle, to humanity. By giving users an avenue to commemorate and share their positive moments with close ones, I hope that Moments will help people remember to appreciate the small things.</p>
